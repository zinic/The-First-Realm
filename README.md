## The First Realm
#### A Pathfinder Campign Setting

This campaign setting is a work in progress.

Inside this repo there are two OpenOffice (odt) formatted documents included. One
document represents the version of the campaign setting that the GM should have
and read from. It contains additional information that requires player characters
to perform certain skill checks to acquire. In addition, it provides additional
disposition information for NPC characters of the various areas described within
the cammpaign. Lastly, the GM version of the document also contains various plot
points and potential campaign mission hooks.

The second document is a player version of the campaign setting that has all of the
GM specific information removed. This is done so that players are given a baseline
for becoming familiar with the setting and its components without spoiling any of
the plots, mysteries and discoveries that await them.
